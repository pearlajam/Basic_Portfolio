        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
        My name is Perla Riojas and I'm a first generation Mexican-American from Texas. 
        My only background in coding was back in the Myspace days, so it's been a while. I like long romantic
        walks to the fridge and bothering my cats enough so that one day they may finally love me. 
        Aside from coding, my interests include music, photography, films and traveling. My favorite thing to do is 
        go to concerts and travel. I've been collecting records over the last 5 years and am a proud owner
        of an original 'Thriller' lp.
        My goal after I complete this program is to one day be able to create a social media platform that
        is completely focused on music and activism. Another goal of mine to one day work for Snapchat.
        I believe that the University of Utah's Coding Bootcamp will provide me all the tools necessary
        to be successful in my future endeavors.
